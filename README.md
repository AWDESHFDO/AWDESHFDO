Hi, I'm Awdesh Fernando currently pursuing my Master’s in Electrical Engineering at Texas A&M University. My main interests lie in power electronics, electric drives, and sustainable energy systems. I enjoy working on real-world engineering problems where I can apply design, control, and hardware development skills to build efficient and reliable systems.

I completed my undergraduate degree in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from Vellore Institute of Technology (VIT). During that time, I gained hands-on experience with power converter design, motor control, and PCB development. I’ve also worked with tools like MATLAB, Simulink, Altium Designer, and SolidWorks.

I’ve had the opportunity to intern at WARAR Energy, where I contributed to projects related to renewable energy and converter topologies. Along the way, I’ve also presented research at the 13th International Conference at IIT Roorkee, which helped me strengthen my analytical and technical writing skills.

I’m passionate about learning, collaborating, and building solutions that make power and energy systems more efficient and sustainable. Currently, I’m looking for opportunities (Summer 2026) to apply my skills and grow further in this field.
